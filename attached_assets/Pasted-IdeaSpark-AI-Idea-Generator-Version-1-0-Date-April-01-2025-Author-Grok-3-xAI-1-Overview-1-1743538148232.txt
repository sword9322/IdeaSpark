7. Risks & Mitigations
Risk: AI generates irrelevant or low-quality ideas.
Mitigation: Fine-tune the prompt format and retry requests if output is poor. Add a fallback list of generic ideas per category.
Risk: High API costs or latency with AI model.
Mitigation: Use Hugging Face’s free tier initially, cache common prompts, and optimize API calls.
Risk: Low adoption due to lack of awareness.
Mitigation: Seed initial ideas (e.g., “Business ideas for beginners”) and share on social media.
